Basic outline of what is in this directory

WCS - class that reads the apfgwcs keywords and creates an object that
has those values for mapping RA/Dec to position on the guider and back,
has methods for doing the mapping

Pos - class that provides an object that is the position components of
scriptobs line, maps between R.A. and Dec. and pixel position on the
guider assuming a WCS object - NOT USED

Star - class that maps a starlist line into an object, duplication w/
Pos

Slitbox - class that maps slitbox status into an object, can update
keywords in appropriate services, can effectively replace autoslitbox
- threaded

XPA - class that handles some XPA tasks needed to replicate autoslitbox

GuidePos - class for updating the guide position for a Star object not
on the slit center - threaded - controlled via setting an object

guide_pos - guides on a position - DOES NOT WORK

offset_guide - reads in a starlist of pairs, an offset guide star and
a target star, acquires offset star, then moves to target, and guides
assuming that target star is in slit, DOES NOT TAKE A SPECTRUM

offset_blind - performs blind offsets from an acquisition star, much
more like scriptobs in functionality 

scriptobs_offset - merger of above, does scriptobs like funcationality
